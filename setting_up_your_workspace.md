## Setting up your vagrant environment

### What is vagrant

Vagrant is a tool that allows you to (in the words of their own site) "create and configure lightweight, reproducible, and portable development environments" easily. With that being the case, it is a great tool for testing your Puppet code locally on your machine as well as for development.

You can read more about vagrant at their official page [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/).

### Downloading an environment

There are a couple of example vagrant environments that you can use for local development.
